## Features

- üîç Semantic search across RIF Open Calls documents
- üåê Supports multilingual queries
- üìÑ Automatic PDF document fetching and processing
- üí° Natural language understanding
- ü§ñ Easy-to-use Telegram interface

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Telegram Bot Token (get it from [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather))
- Internet connection for downloading PDFs

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd rif-opencalls-bot
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On Unix or MacOS
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Telegram bot token:
```
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token_here
```

## Project Structure

- `bot.py` - Main Telegram bot implementation
- `FAISS_loader.py` - FAISS vector store implementation for semantic search
- `PDF_loader.py` - PDF document downloader and processor
- `pdfs/` - Directory where PDF documents are stored
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

## Usage

1. Start the bot:
```bash
python bot.py
```

2. Open Telegram and search for your bot using the username you set up with BotFather

3. Start interacting with the bot:
   - Send `/start` to get a welcome message
   - Send `/help` to see available commands
   - Ask questions in natural language about RIF Open Calls

Example questions:
- "Which programmes suit a company of 4 people?"
- "Which calls are for agritech startups?"
- "Which calls expire in May?"

## How It Works

1. The bot automatically downloads PDF documents from the RIF website
2. Documents are processed and split into chunks
3. Text chunks are embedded using a multilingual model
4. FAISS is used to create a searchable vector store
5. When a user asks a question, it's converted to an embedding and searched against the vector store
6. The most relevant document chunks are returned as answers

## Environment Variables

- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`: Your Telegram Bot API token
